Django Varnish
================

Varnish is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator.
For more information checkout `Varnish Site <http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/>`_

Django Varnish works with Varnish server(s) to manage caching of object pages.
It allows you to monitor certain models and when they are updated,
Django Varnish will purge the model's absolute_url on your frontend(s).
This ensures that object detail pages are served blazingly fast and are always up to date.
You may also go in and manually tweak things (such as your VCL configuration) using a management command. 


Setup
-------
1. Install the `varnish python bindings <http://github.com/justquick/python-varnish>`_
2. Put ``varnishapp`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` then set a few more settings.
3. Add ``(r'^admin/varnish/', include('varnishapp.urls')),`` to your urlconf

Configure
------------
``VARNISH_WATCHED_MODELS`` is a list of installed models whose absolute_urls you want to purge from your
Varnish cache upon saving. Example: ``('auth.user','profiles.profile')``

``VARNISH_MANAGEMENT_ADDRS`` is a list of Varnish cache addresses (containing their management ports).
Example ``('server1:6082','server2:6082')``

Management
-------------

You can view the status of your Varnish cache servers by going to ``/admin/varnish/`` and being a superuser. `Here is what it looks like in production <http://wiki.github.com/justquick/django-varnish/>`_.

Run the management command ``varnishmgt`` to blindly execute arguments to all Varnish backends. Example::

    $ ./manage.py varnishmgt purge_url "/"
